[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) (formerly known as Hudson) is a continuous integration tool.

There is a plugin for using Brakeman available [here](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman-jenkins-plugin). This plugin will allow you to run Brakeman automatically when code changes and aggregate the results.

Check [here](docs/jenkins/installation) for instructions on how to install the plugin.
